  <div> I currently go to UMD and major in CS, but spend almost all my free time reading. I love how the publishing industry has started focusing on minority authors with the creation of "own voices". My favorite author is Celeste Ng, more specifically her book <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">"Everything I Never Told You."</span> </div>

<div>
One thing I hate is how school discourages people from reading. <p class="ex2">I've hated every single book I was required to read for school.</p>

I hope that when people look into reading different genres that aren't academic, they can realize how fulfilling reading is. <p class="ex3">After all, books are a uniquely portable magic.</p>
